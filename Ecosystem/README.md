# My Ecosystem and Game so Far

## How to Play Them
Open the Ecosystem or Game folder. Then, open a terminal in that folder. Now, run `python3 -m http.server` or `python -m http.server` or `py -m http.server` depending on which version of Python you have installed. Finally, open localhost:8000 in your web browser or whatever port it gives you.
## Brief Descriptions
### Ecosystem
The ecosystem is mainly a forest ecosystem. It consists of a bear hunting for bee hives and a bee, whose models were created in Blender with the help of some very useful tutorials, at each bee hive just helplessly watching because defensive behaviors have not been implemented.
### Game
The game consists of a small, procedurally generated map, which was implemented with the help of Sebastian Lague's tutorial series, and a cube that is meant to be the player. It is currently a buggy mess because I have not been able to figure out collisions or how to assure that the mouse's raycast always touches the floor. Those two issues may be related.
## Game Controls
So far, the only control in the game is right click to move the cube to a particular location.
